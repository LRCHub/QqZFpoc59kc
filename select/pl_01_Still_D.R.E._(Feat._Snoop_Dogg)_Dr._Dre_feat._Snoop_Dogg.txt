It's still Dre Day A K
Before I chrom the lot
can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots
that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk
when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage
but haters say Dre fell off
How My last album was
The Chronic
They want to know
f he still got it
They say rap's changed
they want to know how
I feel about it
If you ain't up on pace
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
still with the beats
Still not loving police
Still rock my khakis
with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets
repping 213
Still the beat bangs
still doing my thang
Since I left
ain't too much changed still
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got
love for the streets
it's the D-R-E
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got love
for the streets
it's the D-R-E
Since the last time
you heard from me
I lost a friend
Well, hell, me and Snoop
we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets
signed Eminem
He's triple platinum
doing 50 a week
Still, stay close to the heat
And even when
I was close to defeat
I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack
I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like
Cali weed I smoke till' I sleep
Wake up in the
A.M compose a beat
I bring the fire till you're
soaking in your seat
It's not a fuke
it's been tried
I'm the troop
It's Turn Out the Lights
from the World Class
Wreckin' Crue
I'm still at it
After mathmatic
In the home of drivebys
and a.k matics
Swap meets, sticky green
and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin
D.R.E
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got
love for the streets
it's the D-R-E
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got love
for the streets
it's the D-R-E
It ain't nothing
but more hot shi*t
Another classic CD
for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling
on a corner
with your fly bitc*h
Laid back in the shack
play this track
I'm representing
for the gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
I'll break your neck
damn near put your
face in your lap
Try to be the king
but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still
running the game
Still got it wrapped
like a mummy
Still ain't tripping
love to see young blacks
get money
Spend time out the hood
take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs
no more living hard
Barbeques every day
driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for
them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got
love for the streets
it's the D-R-E
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time
to perfect the beat
And I still got
love for the streets
it's the D-R-E
I'm representing
for them gangstas
all across the world
Still hitting them corners
in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to
perfect the beat
And I still got
love for the streets
it's the D-R-E
Like that, right back up in ya
'95 plus four pennies
Add that up, D R E right
back on top of thangs'
Smoke some with your dog
No stress, no seeds
no sims', no sticks
Some of that real sticky icky'
A little weed, put it in the air
For you's a fool D.R.E
