[00:23.27] Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
[00:26.09] 'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
[00:28.58] You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
[00:55.58] 
[00:30.92] Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
[00:33.92] How nigga? My last album was The Chronic
[00:36.78] They want to know if he still got it
[00:38.98] They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
[01:09.48] 
[00:41.60] (If you ain't up on thangs)
[00:55.10]

[00:59.35] Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
[01:20.85] 
[01:01.78] I'm representin' for the gangsters all across the world (still)
[01:04.27] Hittin' them corners in them low, low's girl (still)

[01:32.72] Still, I stay close to the heat
[01:34.78] And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
[01:38.13] My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
[01:40.38] Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
[02:03.38] 
[01:43.15] Wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
[01:45.73] I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
[01:48.67] It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
[01:50.67] Since, Turn Off the Lights, from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
[02:21.17] 
[01:53.65] I'm still at it, After-mathematics
[01:56.66] In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
[01:59.16] Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
[02:01.65] I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E
[02:19.65]

[02:34.47] I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
[02:36.82] (Still, hittin' them corners in them low, low's girl)
