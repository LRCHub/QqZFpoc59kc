[00:15.64] Oh, for sure, yeah, check me out
[00:31.64] 
[00:20.66] It's still Dre Day (ah), A.K. (ah)
[00:23.52] Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
[00:26.16] 'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
[00:28.58] You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
[00:31.07] Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
[00:34.15] How n-? My last album was The Chronic
[00:36.73] They wanna know if he still got it
[00:38.55] They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
[00:41.50] (If you ain't up on thangs)
[00:55.00] 
[00:43.79] Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
[00:46.54] Still, puffin' my leafs, still f- with the beats
[00:49.50] Still not lovin' police (Uh huh)
[00:51.03] Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
[00:53.78] Still got love for the streets, repping 213
[00:56.81] Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
[00:59.36] Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
[01:20.86] 
[01:01.86] I'm representin' for the gangsters all across the world
[01:04.46] Still, hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl

[01:45.81] 
[01:22.31] Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
[01:24.92] Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
[01:27.82] Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
[01:30.53] He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
[01:32.69] Still, I stay close to the heat
[01:34.98] And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
[01:38.07] My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
[01:40.45] Treat rap like Cali' weed, I smoke 'til I'm sleep
[02:04.95] 
[01:43.20] Wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
[01:45.93] I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
[01:48.54] It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
[01:50.86] It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
[01:53.89] I'm still at it, After-mathematics
[01:56.38] In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
[01:59.10] Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
[02:01.69] I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E
[02:19.69] 
[02:03.56] I'm representin' for the gangsters all across the world

[03:02.49] 
[02:39.11] I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
[02:42.13] N- try to be the king but the ace is back
[02:44.30] (So if you ain't up on thangs)
[02:47.14] Dr. Dre be the name still runnin' the game
[02:49.85] Still got it wrapped like a mummy
[02:52.00] Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
[02:55.03] Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
[02:57.53] Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
[03:00.15] Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
[03:03.43] Still gonna get mine regardless

[03:39.71] 9-5 plus four pennies, add that sh- up
[03:42.97] D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
[03:46.12] Smoke some with your dog
[03:48.22] No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks
[03:51.84] Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
[03:54.16] Ooh-wee, put it in the air
[03:57.77] Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha
